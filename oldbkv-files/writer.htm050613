<h2>Brian K. Vagnini- Writer</h2>

<p> My first story ever was an 8th grade English assignment. It was good (for an eighth grader), but pretty horrible by today's standards.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2007, where I discovered <a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">NanoWrimo</a>, courtesy of a blogger I've never met, but read daily. I competed in 2007 and won in 2008 (meaning I finished the 50,000 word rough draft in 30 days or less) (FYI: 26 days...). 
</p>
<h3> Novels</h3>
<p>That book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=brian+k+vagnini" target="_blank">"The Family Business"</a>. </p>

<br /><br />
<p>The following year, I competed again, with the sequel, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=brian+k+vagnini" target="_blank">"The Trials of Elijah Marcus Ash"</a>. Finished in 28 days.</p>

<h3> Blogging</h3>
<p> I started actively blogging prior to 2008, though, starting up two blogs, one focused on web design, called  <a href="http://wicketbang.com" target="_blank">wicketbang.com</a> and the other, my general thoughts on music production and <a href="http://www.greymatterideas.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">life in general</a>.</p>

<p> My first serious blogging came about when I contributed to <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/author/bkvagnini" target="_blank">LifeHack.org</a>, followed by <a href="http://showwatcher.com/author/brian-vagnini/" target="_blank">ShowWatcher.com</a>.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there, I wrote (on a lark, really) a short selection of Haiku poems. It's called <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/109356370/30-Days-of-IT-Haiku-5x8" target="_blank">"30 days of IT Haiku"</a>.</p>

<h3> Technical Writing</h3>
<p><strong>"The Modern Website" </strong>(on hold)</p>

<p><a href="http://virtualdotcompanies.com/" target="_blank">"virtual . companies"</a> (coming soon)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/109356370/30-Days-of-IT-Haiku-5x8" target="_blank">"30 days of IT Haiku"</a></p>

<p><a href="http://lessonsfromthetrenches.com/" target="_blank">"Lessons from the Trenches- How to be a GOOD Network Administrator"</a> (coming soon)</p>


<h3>Competitions</h3>

<p>I have participated 6 times (3 wins - 3 quit) in Nanowrimo, twice in Blog Action Day and once for ScriptFrenzy.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p> Future plans include serious revisions to the first two books, along with finally editing the third in the series, called "Scarlett", and then re-releasing it as a volume called <a href="http://www.ashfamilysaga.com" target="_blank">"The Ash Family Saga"</a>. <br />
In addition, I will be finishing up several short stories that are in process and bundling them as a collection. No title as of yet.</p>
