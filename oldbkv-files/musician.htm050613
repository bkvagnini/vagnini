<h2>Brian K. Vagnini- Musician</h2>
<h3>music = life!</h3>
<img src="images/me-gtr.jpg" alt"me playing guitar on the couch" width="704" height="598" />
<p>I've been playing music since 1985 and I play electric bass (5 string), guitar, drums and keyboards. I dabble at the upright bass and the cello.</p>
<p> I started recording music with two cassette decks, but really didn't get into the production process until I went to Korea in 1988, where I discovered the joys of multi-track recording.</p>
<p>In 2000, I moved the recording studio to the computer and haven't stopped since then.</p>
